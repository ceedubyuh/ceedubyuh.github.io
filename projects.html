          <li>Bionet</li>
            <p>Bionet is a Progressive Web Application that uses HTML, CSS and Javascript to cache a database so the user can view it online or offline. 
              Bionet was created for my senior project, and I did a majority of the programming.</p>

              <li>NotCarGurus</li>
            <p>NotCarGurus is a database project that sought to mimic the functionalities of a website like CarGurus. This was built for class project with a team of 4, including myself. 
              I was mostly tasked with creating the data and writing the SQL queries while the frontend was done by others.</p>

          <li>Python CSV Interpreter</li>
            <p>For this project, my group and I were given a .csv file containing over 700,000 lines of data, with various columns. It was our job to sift through that data, 
              using a python script, to find the data that was deemed "good" and answer the predetermined
              questions our professor wanted answered from the data.
